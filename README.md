# Google Api - Milestone Project 2

### User-Centric Front-End Development Project

In this project, I was asked to create a single page application for a travel company. This application allowes the user to search for their dream holiday destination, accomadation,
nearby bars and restraunts, and even tourist attractions within the area. When planning your holiday it's best to know what the area your planning to stay in has to offer for you. 
This application give the user that exact information.

## UX DESIGN

This application isn't for booking a holiday. But for finding the best food, drink, entertainment and things to do surroudning your desired destination. The user is able to see the ratings of every hotel,
resteraunt, and bar. and also see the address and contact information of each establishment.

## User Stories:

- As a User I want to be able to see other peoples reviews for specific places for example, a restaurant, so that I have a good understanding on whether or not that place would be worth going to.
- As a User I want to be able to search for specific areas, so that my searches aren't limited.
- As a User I want to search for bars and restaurants, so that I get an understanding of where places are so I can plan my stay.
- As a User I want to select a specific bar, restaurant or hotel and get the correct contact details and address for that place, so that I can give a place a call to reserve a table if need be.

### Features Used in This Project:

- Being able to search for any location in the world.
- Find the closest accomodation/bars/restaurants in that area.
- View the ratings of each hotel/bar/restaurant.
- View the contact details and address of each hotel/bar/restaurant.
- View and select the tourist attractions/points of interest within the specified area.
- Added reset button to refresh the page if you wish to restart your search.

### The Technologies I Have Used:

- **[Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/)**
- **[Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro)**
- **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)** - I used Bootstrap for creating a grid system so I could make my application responisve.
- **[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)** - I used Balsamiq to creata the wireframes for my project **[Here](https://github.com/Azza434/IFDMilestoneProject/tree/master/wireframe)**.

## TESTING

I conducted tests on a wide selction of browsers/devices to ensure User's can successfully use the site and it's features.

Tests conducted:

- Checking the functionality of the Google Maps Api, making sure everything worked as it should
- Making sure the code runs wihtout issues using the **[Google Chrome Inspect](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/shortcuts)** Tools.
Inside Chromes Dev Tools I can:
    - Check the responsiveness for individual phones and screens, example, an IPhone/Samsung.
    - Use the console to check the stability of my **[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)** files so that there is no errors and it is not broken.
    - I can also change and adapt my code inside the Tools, to see what works and what doesn't. Also staying aware that these changes I make are not permenant.

Here is each Validator used:

- **[HTML](https://html5.validator.nu/)**
- **[CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)**
- **[JavaScript](http://esprima.org/demo/validate.html)**


These tests included browsers/devices:

- Edge - Windows Computer
- Mozilla - Windows Computer
- Chrome - Windows Computer and iPhone
- Safari - iPhone
- Internet Explorer - Windows Computer

### User Stories Testing

- "As a User I want to be able to see other peoples reviews for specific places for example, a restaurant, so that I have a good understanding on whether or not that place would be worth going to." 
**I have tested this by clicking on individual places making sure the details are all there and easily viewed.**
- "As a User I want to be able to search for specific areas, so that my searches aren't limited." 
**This was tested by me typing in specific places such as London.**
- "As a User I want to search for bars and restaurants, so that I get an understanding of where places are so I can plan my stay."
**This was tested by making sure I had correctly used the API to fetch the correct places for that location.**
- "As a User I want to select a specific bar, restaurant or hotel and get the correct contact details and address for that place, so that I can give a place a call to reserve a table if need be."
**This was tested by again making sure I had used Google's API correctly and it was showing the correct infomation.**

## DEPLOYMENT

I have been commiting every finished functionality, and every bug fix, to GitHub using **[Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/workspaces/)**.

I have fully deployed this application to GitHub Pages which can be found **[Here](https://azza434.github.io/IFDMilestoneProject/.)**.
